The interaction will involve a momentary tap or sustained pressure on the lid, simulating the action of lifting it. The wooden texture will provide a tactile feedback, and users may feel a slight resistance as they push down before the lid opens. The chest will respond by visually animating the lid opening, possibly with a creaking sound to enhance the realism."

Users will experience a satisfying feedback from the bag as it sways and rebounds after each punch, enhancing the physicality of the interaction."
