The interaction will likely involve a pressing motion to push down on the lid, followed by a pulling motion to lift it open. The chest's wooden texture will provide a tactile feedback, and users may feel the resistance of the hinged lid as they open it. The interaction is expected to be momentary as they quickly access the contents inside."

This requires careful control and dexterity, as users will need to ensure the key aligns properly with the lock."

Users will feel the inertia as they swing and the impact feedback when the hammer strikes an object, simulating a realistic hammering experience."
