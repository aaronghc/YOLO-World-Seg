The interaction will likely involve a momentary tap to initiate the opening mechanism, followed by a sustained contact as they lift the lid. The wooden texture will provide a tactile feedback, and users may feel a slight resistance when pushing down before the lid opens. The chest's dimensions suggest it is large enough for both hands to interact comfortably."

The interaction will be brief but precise, requiring careful alignment with the lock."

The interaction will involve lifting the hammer and swinging it downwards to smash objects. The relatively heavy design with a concentrated center of mass will provide significant inertia, making the hammer feel substantial in the user's hands. Users will experience a strong haptic feedback upon impact, simulating the sensation of smashing through resistance."

The interaction will involve a momentary contact as they hit the bag, with a feeling of softness upon impact. Users may also use their palms or forearms for a more sustained contact, feeling the bag give slightly under pressure. The punching bag's dimensions suggest it is large enough to accommodate various striking techniques, allowing users to blow off steam effectively."
