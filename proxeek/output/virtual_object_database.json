    "interactionDeduction": "Because the hammer is a grasp object with a cylindrical handle roughly 38 cm long, users will wrap their fingers and thumb around the handle in a power-grip, most often near the lower end to maximize leverage (dominant hand). Some users may steady the head with the non-dominant hand when positioning it. Typical manipulation patterns include raising the tool by flexing the elbow and shoulder, then accelerating it in an arcing swing; the wrist stays semi-locked until the end of the stroke, when it may snap forward for extra speed. The top-heavy inertia means the user immediately feels the metal head trying to lag behind when lifting and trying to carry through when stopping; this encourages deliberate follow-through motions and requires counter-torque in the forearm to halt recoil. During impact the virtual head should appear to stop abruptly while a vibration or \u2018kick\u2019 propagates up the handle, conveying a rigid, high-hardness collision. If the user changes grip (e.g., choking up close to the head) the perceived moment of inertia drops, enabling more precise light taps. Users may also rotate the wrist to flip the striking face or to orient the hammer for side blows. In essence: firm cylindrical power-grip, arm-swinging strike motions, pronounced momentum and jolt feedback on impact, with the object visually and aurally reacting like a solid steel-headed tool."

    "interactionDeduction": "As a contact object, users will typically extend an index finger or thumb and apply a straight-on press to the center of the red cap. Alternative interactions include a palm slap or fist bump when urgency is implied, but all involve a perpendicular downward motion. The press is momentary: finger descends ~4 cm, compressing an internal spring that produces increasing resistance; tactile feedback peaks at full travel, often accompanied by a click. Users then release, letting the spring return the cap so the finger loses contact after rebound. The contact area is fingertip-sized (15 cm diameter cap gives ample target). Interaction duration is brief (\u22640.5 s) unless the scene requires a sustained hold, in which case the user must maintain steady pressure against the spring. Visually the button depresses, audibly clicks, and resets; haptically the user perceives progressive force, a soft bottom-out, followed by a lighter upward force as the cap returns."
