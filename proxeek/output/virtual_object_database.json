    "interactionDeduction": "The user will employ a power-grip, wrapping their entire hand around the cylindrical wooden handle roughly 3\u20134 cm in diameter. Fingers curl fully while the thumb clamps over them, creating a secure fist-like hold that lets the wrist control the head-heavy tool. Interaction begins by lifting the hammer: the user instantly notices inertia bias toward the metal head, so the wrist naturally tilts slightly downward unless counterbalanced by forearm muscles. Typical manipulation consists of rhythmic swinging arcs\u2014either short wrist-flick taps for light blows or full elbow/shoulder swings for forceful strikes. During each swing the handle acts as a lever: the user\u2019s hand is the pivot, the heavy head accelerates, then decelerates abruptly on impact. The hammer\u2019s outline transmits a straight, 0.4 m rod terminating in a rectangular mass; the grip stops at the neck so the head seldom touches the hand. Upon collision with virtual targets, the user expects sudden stop and reverberation travelling back through the handle, signalling object hardness and successful impact. The tool itself is rigid and undeforming, staying cool and metallic at the head and warm wood along the shaft, though only the wooden section is normally in contact with the palm. Overall, the interaction pattern is: grasp firmly \u2192 raise \u2192 align head with target \u2192 swing in an arc \u2192 feel mass pull \u2192 brief forceful contact \u2192 possible quick re-chamber or repeat strokes."
