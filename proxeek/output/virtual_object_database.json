    "interactionDeduction": "The user will approach the mug\u2019s handle with a semi-open C-shape power grip, curling 2\u20133 fingers around the slender 2 cm-diameter rod while the thumb opposes from the outside. The hand closes until the handle rests against the proximal phalanges, giving a stable lever to lift. The wrist then pivots to raise the mug toward the mouth; elbow flexion provides the bulk of the lift while shoulder abducts slightly. Just before drinking, the wrist pronates and then slowly tilts the mug so the liquid flows toward the rim. Throughout the tilt the user perceives moderate liquid weight and a shifting center of mass that creates a small rotational moment around the handle. Micro-adjustments of finger force stabilize the mug against this torque. After sipping, the wrist supinates to level the mug and the arm lowers it back. If the mug is set on a surface, contact is made with the flat base first, producing a short normal impulse. The mug itself offers no compliance, so the haptic response is rigid and inert; any slosh in the liquid would be perceived only visually or through subtle controller vibration."

    "interactionDeduction": "The user employs a single-handed power grip, wrapping all fingers and thumb tightly around the lower portion of the cylindrical wooden handle. The grip axis aligns roughly with the forearm to maximize control. Because the head is heavy, the user feels an immediate forward/top-heavy inertia that tries to droop the blade downward. Swinging involves drawing the axe backward (elbow flexion, shoulder extension), then a rapid shoulder flexion and elbow extension to drive the blade in an arcing path. The wrist remains fairly stiff, adding a minor pronation snap just before impact. After contact with a virtual target, the head virtually decelerates abruptly, sending a simulated recoil up the handle; the user experiences this as controller vibration coupled with a torque impulse that momentarily pulls the handle out of line. If the user keeps chopping, they reset the axe by lifting it using more shoulder than wrist, repeating the cycle."

    "interactionDeduction": "The hammer is grasped in a power grip similar to the axe, but higher up on the handle to shorten the lever for better control. The head-heavy inertia is instantly apparent, urging the head to dip. Typical use is a vertical pounding motion: the user raises the hammer by flexing the elbow and shoulder, then rapidly extends the elbow and drops the shoulder while keeping the wrist locked, delivering the head straight downward. Upon virtual impact, the hammer head stops suddenly; the user detects a sharp vibration plus a brief upward reactive force, imitating the rebound of a dense object (e.g., striking a nail or anvil). For precision strikes, users may choke up on the handle, sliding the hand closer to the head to reduce swing arc and torque."

    "interactionDeduction": "The sickle is held with a power-pinch hybrid: the fingers wrap around the short cylindrical handle while the thumb presses along the side, allowing blade orientation control. The forearm is pronated so the curved blade faces forward/outward. A typical cut begins with the wrist slightly extended and the elbow flexed. The user then performs a sweeping pull: shoulder abducts minimally, elbow extends a bit, and the wrist flexes while the forearm supinates, drawing the blade in a concave path that hooks and slices through virtual vegetation. Because the curved blade mass is distributed along its arc, the user feels a modest forward inertia but less concentrated than an axe. On contact, the blade drags through material, producing continuous low-frequency vibration and gentle resistance rather than a single impact jolt. After the follow-through, the user resets by rotating the wrist back and bringing the sickle forward for another stroke."
