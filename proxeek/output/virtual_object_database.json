    "interactionDeduction": "The user will perform a cylindrical power-grip around the vertical wooden handle (\u22482 cm diameter). Fingers curl fully around the rod while the thumb opposes on the far side, similar to holding a thick marker. Once secured, the forearm is raised and the wrist supinates to bring the lip of the mug toward the mouth. The elbow flexes and the shoulder raises for sipping motions, followed by gentle wrist pronation to set the mug back down. Because the mug is bottom-heavy (liquid plus a metal-banded base), the user will feel a noticeable downward moment when the mug is tilted; they must counterbalance with wrist torque. During manipulation the mug itself remains rigid, giving no deformation feedback\u2014only the shift of liquid weight that creates a slight lag on direction changes. No finger repositioning is expected once the grip is established; interaction is dominated by forearm and wrist articulation."

    "interactionDeduction": "The user secures a firm saber-style power grip around the lower portion of the wooden handle, thumb and fingers wrapping fully to stabilize against rotational torque. Primary motions are broad shoulder-driven swings with elbow extension, producing an arcing trajectory that brings the heavy metal head downward or sideways toward a target. The head-heavy inertia causes the tool to lag slightly behind hand motion on initiation and to continue forward after the hand begins decelerating, so the user feels the need to brace and absorb recoil on impact. Fine orientation adjustments (edge alignment) are made through wrist pronation/supination, but most force is generated through gross arm motion. The axe stays rigid; the only feedback change is inertial, not shape or compliance."

    "interactionDeduction": "The user employs a carpentry-style power grip a bit above the handle\u2019s end, wrapping all fingers and the thumb around the cylindrical shaft. Striking actions involve short, controlled elbow flexion/extension combined with wrist snap to accelerate the head downward onto a virtual surface. The pronounced head-heavy mass creates a pendulum effect: once the swing starts, the user feels momentum pulling the handle forward, and upon impact must absorb rebound through wrist stiffness and slight elbow give. The hammer remains completely rigid; the response is felt only as sudden deceleration and possible vibration cues at the moment of contact."

    "interactionDeduction": "The user adopts a pistol-like power grip around the short handle, with the index finger often extended along the handle for directional control while the remaining fingers wrap underneath. Cutting motions are compact sweeping arcs generated by wrist ulnar deviation and forearm rotation, allowing the curved blade to hook around vegetation. After hooking, the user pulls the tool toward the body with elbow flexion to slice through the target. Moderate forward-weighted inertia means the curved blade feels present but not as concentrated as a hammer or axe head; it provides steady guidance during the pull without excessive overshoot. The tool stays rigid; feedback comes from continuous resistance during the pulling slice rather than a single impact."
