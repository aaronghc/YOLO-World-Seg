The stack of pages forms a broad, weighty \u2018head\u2019 that sticks out from your grip. Swinging it produces a clear moment of inertia because the paper mass lags and then follows through, echoing the feel of a hammer\u2019s metal head. Lightly tapping the page block against your other palm gives a firm, sudden stop that reinforces the impact sensation."
