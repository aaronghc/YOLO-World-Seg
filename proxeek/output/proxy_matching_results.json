Hand orientation keeps the wrist neutral and allows the forearm to apply pressure downward. Interaction involves broad shoulder and elbow motions: lift to position, press, then long forward/backward strokes while the foam cylinder spins on its axle. Because the foam head is offset from the handle by a metal arm, the tool feels slightly top-heavy; users sense moderate rotational inertia when starting or stopping the roll. The roller resists lateral twisting but spins freely along its axis, providing continuous rolling feedback and low-frequency vibration as the textured foam contacts the wall or canvas. The user may periodically tilt the wrist to reload paint or to reach edges, and can exert extra force to compress the foam against the surface, feeling mild compliance at the contact patch."

      "interactionDeduction": "The roller is grasped with a firm power grip around its contoured handle\u2014fingers wrap completely while the thumb opposes for control. Hand orientation keeps the wrist neutral and allows the forearm to apply pressure downward. Interaction involves broad shoulder and elbow motions: lift to position, press, then long forward/backward strokes while the foam cylinder spins on its axle. Because the foam head is offset from the handle by a metal arm, the tool feels slightly top-heavy; users sense moderate rotational inertia when starting or stopping the roll. The roller resists lateral twisting but spins freely along its axis, providing continuous rolling feedback and low-frequency vibration as the textured foam contacts the wall or canvas. The user may periodically tilt the wrist to reload paint or to reach edges, and can exert extra force to compress the foam against the surface, feeling mild compliance at the contact patch."
