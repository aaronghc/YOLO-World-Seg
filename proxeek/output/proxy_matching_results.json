Cutting motions involve sweeping, crescent-shaped pulls driven by elbow flexion and wrist ulnar deviation, keeping the blade\u2019s inside edge engaged with virtual vegetation. Because the curved blade carries moderate distributed mass, users experience forward-weighted inertia but with less torque than an axe; the tool feels agile for quick, repetitive slices. When a cut connects, the user perceives progressive resistance\u2014as if stalks are being severed\u2014followed by a brief release once the slice completes. Successive reaping motions are rhythmic, with the wrist resetting after each pull. The user may also reverse-rotate the wrist to shake debris off the blade before continuing."
