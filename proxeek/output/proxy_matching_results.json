      "interactionDeduction": "As a contact object, users will typically extend an index finger or thumb and apply a straight-on press to the center of the red cap. Alternative interactions include a palm slap or fist bump when urgency is implied, but all involve a perpendicular downward motion. The press is momentary: finger descends ~4 cm, compressing an internal spring that produces increasing resistance; tactile feedback peaks at full travel, often accompanied by a click. Users then release, letting the spring return the cap so the finger loses contact after rebound. The contact area is fingertip-sized (15 cm diameter cap gives ample target). Interaction duration is brief (\u22640.5 s) unless the scene requires a sustained hold, in which case the user must maintain steady pressure against the spring. Visually the button depresses, audibly clicks, and resets; haptically the user perceives progressive force, a soft bottom-out, followed by a lighter upward force as the cap returns."
