The head-heavy inertia is instantly apparent, urging the head to dip. Typical use is a vertical pounding motion: the user raises the hammer by flexing the elbow and shoulder, then rapidly extends the elbow and drops the shoulder while keeping the wrist locked, delivering the head straight downward. Upon virtual impact, the hammer head stops suddenly; the user detects a sharp vibration plus a brief upward reactive force, imitating the rebound of a dense object (e.g., striking a nail or anvil). For precision strikes, users may choke up on the handle, sliding the hand closer to the head to reduce swing arc and torque."
