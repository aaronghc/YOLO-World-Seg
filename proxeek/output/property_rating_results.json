    "explanation": "The controller\u2019s grip diameter matches a small hammer handle, and the black top is slightly heavier than the rest, but the entire unit is very light plastic (~100 g). The mass does not pull the wrist downward during swings, so the head-heavy moment and overall momentum feel noticeably under-scaled.",

    "image_id": 0,
    "propertyValue": 0.5,
    "explanation": "When gripped by one corner, most of the keyboard\u2019s ~800 g mass hangs forward, creating a real head-heavy bias that the wrist must counter. However the \u2018handle\u2019 is only a thin edge, not a 30\u201340 cm cylindrical shaft, so leverage control is awkward and the center of rotation is too close to the mass. Provides correct heaviness but wrong geometry.",

Length is much shorter (~12-15 cm vs 40 cm) and the head is plastic and only slightly heavier than the handle, so lever feel and head bias are weak, but the basic outline of a straight handle terminating in a flat disc is present.",
