    "substrateUtilizationMethod": "Lay the plush turtle shell flat on the table. Deliver a chopping motion to the centre dome. The first contact is muffled but definite; continued downward force compresses the foam until it bottoms out against the tabletop, producing a firmer stop. Letting the cylinder rebound off the now-compressed surface creates a sudden lightness that can represent the final break, useful for slower, strength-focused practice swings.",

The precise metal-on-metal tap is extremely sharp; attempting to hold the strike a moment longer forces the screw to topple, instantly removing resistance and letting the cylinder drop, capturing the quick snap of wood fibres giving way.",
