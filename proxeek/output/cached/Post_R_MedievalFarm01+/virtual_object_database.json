    "interactionDeduction": "The user will grasp only the handle, engaging a three-finger precision\u2013power hybrid grip (thumb on one side, index/middle on the opposite, ring finger optionally supporting). Because the handle is a narrow 2 cm rod, the fingers wrap almost completely around it while the palm stays mostly open. Primary manipulation is a forearm supination to raise the rim toward the mouth, then a controlled wrist tilt to pour liquid. While tilting, the user perceives the mug\u2019s center-of-mass pulling forward, so the wrist must counterbalance that torque. Secondary motions include setting the mug down\u2014requiring gentle vertical translation and a brief release of the handle\u2014and possibly small swirling motions to \u2018stir\u2019 contents. The mug itself remains rigid; only its orientation changes. The expected haptic response is a steady weight that shifts as the mug is angled, along with a thin, rounded handle outline under the fingers."

    "interactionDeduction": "The axe is grasped with a firm power grip around the 3 cm-diameter handle; the thumb wraps opposite the four fingers, and the handle rests diagonally across the palm for stability. The dominant hand alone can wield it, or the off-hand may slide up the grip for two-handed swings. Typical motion is an overhead or side-arc swing that employs shoulder rotation, elbow extension, and final wrist snap to accelerate the head. Because of the head-heavy inertia, the user feels the leading edge pulling the grip forward throughout the swing and must decelerate after impact, producing a noticeable rebound. Precision placement (e.g., light chopping) involves short, controlled wrist pronation/supination. Upon striking a virtual surface, the axe head stops abruptly while the handle vibrates, conveying impact. The outline felt in hand stays cylindrical; the blade is not touched directly."

    "interactionDeduction": "The user encloses the 3 cm cylindrical handle with a full power grip, palm centered about 10\u201315 cm from the head for one-handed use; for heavy blows a two-handed grip can be adopted, trailing hand near the butt end. Movements consist of upward cocking followed by rapid downward/forward striking driven by elbow extension and wrist flexion. The hammer\u2019s head-heavy mass creates a pendulum effect, so the user experiences significant torque that assists the downswing and demands counter-torque when recovering. For tasks like tapping, shorter wrist-dominant strokes occur. Upon each virtual impact, the head halts and a brief vibration is expected along the handle. The hammer itself feels rigid; only the user\u2019s grip and arm motions change its orientation."

    "interactionDeduction": "The user employs a one-handed power grip around the 3 cm handle, but with the wrist angled so the curved blade leads outward. Interaction consists of sweeping, hook-like motions: the arm moves in semicircular arcs while the wrist pronates/supinates to drag the inside edge of the blade through virtual vegetation. Because the moderate mass is distributed along the curved blade, inertia feels forward-biased yet evenly spread, giving a smoother follow-through than the axe. Fine harvesting actions involve quick flicks from the wrist, whereas heavier cutting uses a larger shoulder-driven swing. After each pull-through, the user adjusts grip orientation and repeats. The user\u2019s hand never touches the blade; tactile feedback remains the cylindrical wooden grip coupled with a slight forward tug during motion."
