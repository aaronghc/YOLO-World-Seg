The dominant hand alone can wield it, or the off-hand may slide up the grip for two-handed swings. Typical motion is an overhead or side-arc swing that employs shoulder rotation, elbow extension, and final wrist snap to accelerate the head. Because of the head-heavy inertia, the user feels the leading edge pulling the grip forward throughout the swing and must decelerate after impact, producing a noticeable rebound. Precision placement (e.g., light chopping) involves short, controlled wrist pronation/supination.
