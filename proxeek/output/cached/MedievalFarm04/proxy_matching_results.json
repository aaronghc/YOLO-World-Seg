Like a sledge, the mass is concentrated in the rectangular head, so the user repeatedly lifts the tool and drives it downward against nails or objects. Key motion pattern: elbow and wrist flexion during the lift, rapid extension and pronation during the strike, followed by rebound damping. The head-heavy inertia makes the handle feel tip-weighted; once moving, it tends to continue, so the user feels a strong pull that must be checked after each swing. Haptic response at contact should simulate a sharp, short vibration or stop, indicating rigid collision with a solid surface."
