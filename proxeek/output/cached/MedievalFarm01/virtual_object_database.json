    "interactionDeduction": "The user approaches the mug by slipping 2\u20133 fingers (typically index, middle, ring) through the loop-shaped handle while the thumb opposes them on the outer rim of the handle\u2014essentially a relaxed precision-to-power hybrid grip. The handle\u2019s rounded 2 cm-diameter rod dictates that the fingers wrap in a gentle curl rather than a flat pinch. Once secured, the user lifts the mug using elbow flexion and slight wrist ulnar deviation to keep the cup upright, immediately noticing a center-of-mass that sits a few centimeters to the left of the fingers (toward the liquid volume), giving a subtle rotational torque that must be countered. Typical manipulation includes: 1) lifting toward the mouth, 2) tilting about the handle axis to pour, and 3) setting it down with a controlled vertical descent. The mug\u2019s response is rigid, with no deformation, but its inertia changes perceptibly as liquid level changes\u2014heavier when full, lighter after drinking, and producing a modest slosh delay when the orientation is changed quickly."

    "interactionDeduction": "The user uses a firm power grip around the lower third of the wooden handle, fingers wrapping fully and thumb locked, sometimes augmenting with the support hand higher up for two-handed swings. To chop, the dominant hand acts as a pivot while the shoulders and trunk generate a broad downward or diagonal arc; wrist pronation/supination fine-tunes blade alignment moments before impact. Because the mass is concentrated in the metal head, the user feels a pronounced forward weight that encourages a pendulum-like swing; beginning the motion requires effort but once moving the momentum carries through, forcing the user to arrest the motion after the virtual bite. Upon impact the axe stops abruptly in the VR scene, implying a short jolt that the user must absorb, after which the tool may either embed (requiring a tug and rearward pull) or rebound slightly depending on the simulation. Throughout, the cylindrical handle provides a consistent tactile reference with no perceptible compliance."

    "interactionDeduction": "The hammer is grasped with a classic carpentry power grip near the end of the handle: all four fingers wrap and the thumb locks across or alongside them. The head-heavy inertia is felt immediately; small wrist movements lag behind the handle, so the user instinctively employs larger elbow and shoulder motions to raise and accelerate the tool. Striking involves a quick downward swing with wrist flexion just before impact to maximize head velocity. On contact the VR scene depicts a sudden stop accompanied by a brief recoil or bounce, signaling a high-frequency jolt that the user counterbalances by tightening grip and dampening with forearm muscles. Secondary interactions include light taps achieved by half-speed swings and grip repositioning closer to the head for increased control. The handle outline remains rigid and uniform, serving as the main tactile cue."

    "interactionDeduction": "The user grasps the short, cylindrical handle with a firm but slightly choked-up power grip; because the curved blade extends forward and to the side, the wrist is naturally pronated so the palm faces slightly upward, allowing the blade to hook vegetation. Interaction consists of sweeping, semi-circular pulling motions towards the body, generated by elbow flexion and shoulder adduction. The distributed mass along the crescent blade gives a modest forward bias\u2014less dramatic than an axe\u2014but still creates noticeable centrifugal force when swinging quickly, encouraging follow-through. At the moment the blade intersects virtual stalks, the simulation halts or slows movement, conveying resistance as though slicing. The user then resets by rotating the forearm outward and repeating. Fine wrist rotations are used to angle the blade for different cut depths, all the while maintaining a rigid, non-compliant handle outline."
