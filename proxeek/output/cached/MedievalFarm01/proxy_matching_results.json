      "interactionDeduction": "The user grasps the short, cylindrical handle with a firm but slightly choked-up power grip; because the curved blade extends forward and to the side, the wrist is naturally pronated so the palm faces slightly upward, allowing the blade to hook vegetation. Interaction consists of sweeping, semi-circular pulling motions towards the body, generated by elbow flexion and shoulder adduction. The distributed mass along the crescent blade gives a modest forward bias\u2014less dramatic than an axe\u2014but still creates noticeable centrifugal force when swinging quickly, encouraging follow-through. At the moment the blade intersects virtual stalks, the simulation halts or slows movement, conveying resistance as though slicing. The user then resets by rotating the forearm outward and repeating. Fine wrist rotations are used to angle the blade for different cut depths, all the while maintaining a rigid, non-compliant handle outline."
