The user positions the finger above the center of the 15 cm-wide red cap, then applies vertical force. The button travels approximately 4 cm before a hard mechanical stop. During travel, a progressively stiff spring resistance is felt, followed by a tactile click that signals actuation. Upon release, the spring returns the cap to its original height, pushing the user\u2019s finger upward. Typical contact duration is under one second for a tap; sustained presses may occur when holding the action. The surrounding black bezel serves as a visual and physical guide, preventing lateral slip of the finger."
