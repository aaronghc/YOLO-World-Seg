The bulk of the notebook supplies noticeable mass, so lifting then swinging it downward gives strong inertial pull similar to a sledge-hammer action. Bringing the notebook\u2019s flat edge to meet the desk produces a solid, vibration-rich impact through the rigid cover back into the user\u2019s hand."
