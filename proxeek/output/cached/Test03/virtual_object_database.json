During a swing, momentum builds in the head and transmits down the handle into the user\u2019s hand. On impact, users experience a brief but distinct resistance and vibration traveling through the grip, followed by the hammer head\u2019s rebound as they decelerate the motion."

As they turn, they feel continuous, low-friction rotation transmitted through their grip, with subtle resistance from the valve mechanism. If more force is needed, they may grip the spokes individually to gain extra leverage and twist further."
