    "contactUtilizationMethod": "Hold one short edge firmly so the bulk of the box projects forward. The box\u2019s moderate weight and rectangular mass imitate an axe head, making it suitable for forearm-driven chopping gestures and letting users feel abrupt stop inertia on \u2018impact.\u2019",
    "substrateUtilizationMethod": "Place the pen perpendicular to the swing path. A downward chop lands squarely on the hard cylindrical barrel (sharp impact). Continued force makes the pen roll suddenly out from beneath the eraser box, erasing resistance and imitating the dramatic release when wood halves part.",
    "group_index": 10,
    "expectedHapticFeedback": "The user feels sharp initial impact as the axe strikes wood. Tension increases until a sudden satisfying release occurs - the wood cracks and splits completely.",
    "harmony_rating": 5,
    "harmony_explanation": "The crisp cylinder hit and immediate roll-away deliver a quick tension drop, but the release is too abrupt and lacks the buildup of splitting wood, resulting in moderately good coordination.",
    "expressivity_rating": 4,
    "expressivity_explanation": "The pen gives a crisp initial strike and sudden roll-away, but there is almost no gradual tension buildup before release.",
    "realism_rating": 2,
    "realism_explanation": "The initial pen barrel hit is present, but almost no tension builds before it rolls away, resulting in an unrealistic, slide-away release."

    "realism_explanation": "The crisp tap and instant ejection simulate release, but the lack of sustained force buildup and overly light response feel very different from chopping wood."
