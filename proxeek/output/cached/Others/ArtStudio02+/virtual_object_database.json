    "interactionDeduction": "The user will employ a precision tripod grip (thumb, index, and middle finger) around the 1.7 cm-diameter cylindrical body, similar to holding a pen. While drawing, the hand pivots mainly at the wrist and fingers, producing small, controlled translations and rotations of the shaft. The marker stays rigid in the hand; its low mass offers minimal inertial resistance, so strokes feel light and responsive. The felt tip makes intermittent contact with virtual surfaces, giving the sense of point-contact feedback but no deformation of the barrel. Users may also rotate the marker between fingertips to change stroke angle or flip it in the hand to recap it, but the object itself does not visibly compress or change shape."

    "interactionDeduction": "The tube is first grasped with a light power or precision grip near the threaded neck to uncap it (thumb and index finger twist while the other fingers stabilize the body). During paint dispensing, the dominant hand shifts to a power squeeze grip that envelopes the flattened, pliable body; the palm and all fingers apply progressively increasing pressure from the sealed end toward the opening while the tube is aimed downward. The metal/foil body locally collapses under finger pressure, providing noticeable compliance and slowly re-expands if released. The resistance increases as paint volume decreases, giving tactile feedback that content is being expelled."

Users occasionally roll the handle between thumb and index finger to rotate the bristle orientation for line-weight control.

Strokes involve broad shoulder and elbow movement, rolling the top-heavy cylinder along surfaces in long, continuous arcs. As the arm pushes and lifts, the roller head spins freely, generating a mild gyroscopic feel and a repeating vibration or rumble as \u2018paint\u2019 is laid down. Users also perform brief wrist flicks to lift the roller off the surface, perceiving sudden loss of contact and the weight of the roller shifting to the handle. The rigid metal frame does not deform, but the foam cylinder compresses slightly when pressed harder, providing compliant feedback."
