The wrist rotates the mug toward the mouth, tilting about 45\u201390\u00b0 to pour liquid. Because the mug\u2019s center of mass (especially when filled) sits forward of the handle, users will feel a nose-heavy torque that must be countered by tightening their grip and slightly cocking the wrist. After sipping, they reverse the tilt and may place the mug down by lowering the forearm in a gentle arc. Haptically, they will mostly sense the handle\u2019s 2 cm-diameter round wooden rod, the slight ridge where the handle attaches to the metal band, and the inertial shift of sloshing liquid. No significant deformation occurs; the outline stays rigid."

For heavy swings, the dominant hand anchors near the base while the other hand may slide mid-haft and then release just before impact, mimicking realistic two-handed chopping. The motion involves large shoulder and elbow arcs, accelerating and decelerating a head-heavy mass that tries to continue forward after the arms stop, so users feel pronounced inertia in the blade end. On contact with a virtual target, the blade appears to bite and stop while the handle rebounds slightly, requiring the user to brace and possibly pull back. Minor wrist-angle adjustments allow precise targeting, but the axe remains rigid without noticeable flex."

    "interactionDeduction": "Most users will grasp the handle in a firm power grip near its end, thumb along the shaft, to maximize leverage. Swing paths are shorter than the axe\u2014predominantly elbow-driven vertical or diagonal arcs for pounding. The head-heavy inertia produces a pendulum feel: once set into motion, the head wants to keep moving, requiring users to tighten forearm muscles to halt after impact. Feedback includes a sudden stop when the virtual head strikes a surface, followed by a slight recoil felt in the wrist and elbow. The handle outline stays cylindrical and hard; no perceptible flex or compliance is expected."

    "interactionDeduction": "Users hold the short 3 cm-diameter grip with a hybrid power/precision grasp\u2014fingers wrapped but allowing index finger extension along the top for guidance. Cutting motions are sweeping semicircular arcs pulled toward the body, using wrist pronation and elbow flexion. Because the curved blade\u2019s mass is distributed along its arc rather than a single point, the tool feels moderately forward-weighted but more balanced than an axe. As users slice, they sense a gliding resistance as the inner edge would shear through vegetation, followed by a quick follow-through. The blade remains rigid with no flex; contact is concentrated along the edge perimeter, so users keep fingers well back from the curve."
