Typical motions include short stabs into food, scooping gestures, and gentle wrist pronation/supination to turn or twirl food. The fork is light, so inertial feedback is minimal\u2014a quick start-stop with little lag. The narrow handle edges and smooth stainless-steel surface give a cool, rigid feel with no deformation. When the tines strike a plate or food, the user would feel a brief tap or vibration through the handle, after which the fork remains rigid and immediately follows the hand\u2019s next motion."

      "interactionDeduction": "The spoon is held much like the fork\u2014thumb and index/middle fingers pinch the narrow handle while the other fingers cradle it (precision grip). The wrist then tilts to orient the bowl upward for scooping. Typical motions include forward scoops through semi-liquid food, lifting toward the mouth, and gentle rotations to pour contents. The bowl of the spoon adds slight front-heavy weight, so users notice a small inertial lag when starting or stopping motion compared with the handle alone. When fluid content is present, users feel extra mass and shifting momentum. The utensil remains rigid, with a smooth, cool surface and a shallow concave outline that presses against the finger pads."
