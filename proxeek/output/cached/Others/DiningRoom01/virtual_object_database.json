Typical motions include short stabs into food, scooping gestures, and gentle wrist pronation/supination to turn or twirl food. The fork is light, so inertial feedback is minimal\u2014a quick start-stop with little lag. The narrow handle edges and smooth stainless-steel surface give a cool, rigid feel with no deformation. When the tines strike a plate or food, the user would feel a brief tap or vibration through the handle, after which the fork remains rigid and immediately follows the hand\u2019s next motion."

    "interactionDeduction": "The knife is grasped with a hybrid precision/power grip: thumb and index finger pinch either side of the flat handle while the remaining fingers wrap for stability, and the index finger often extends along the spine for guidance. The user performs sawing or downward pressing strokes to cut, or smooth lateral strokes to spread. Each cut involves forearm-driven forward/back translations plus small wrist pivots that keep the blade angled against the food. Because the knife is light and rigid, it follows hand motion closely but gives momentary resistance when the virtual blade meets food\u2014perceived as increased force or brief vibration. The stainless surface feels cool, smooth, and non-compliant throughout."

The wrist then tilts to orient the bowl upward for scooping. Typical motions include forward scoops through semi-liquid food, lifting toward the mouth, and gentle rotations to pour contents. The bowl of the spoon adds slight front-heavy weight, so users notice a small inertial lag when starting or stopping motion compared with the handle alone. When fluid content is present, users feel extra mass and shifting momentum. The utensil remains rigid, with a smooth, cool surface and a shallow concave outline that presses against the finger pads."

Users lift it a few centimeters above the plate and perform rapid wrist flicks\u2014short, repetitive vertical or diagonal shakes\u2014causing the internal granules to rattle. The shifting contents create a slightly delayed weight redistribution that can be felt as a soft inertial lag each time direction changes. The top surface occasionally taps the palm or fingers when inverted, and the user feels the cool, rigid glass/metal surface with shallow ridges where the cap meets the body. The object itself remains rigid, but the moving pepper produces subtle vibration and impact sounds that reinforce the seasoning action."
