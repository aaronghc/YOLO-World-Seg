    "interactionDeduction": "Users will insert their fingers between the mug body and the slender wooden rod-handle, then curl the fingers and thumb into a small power-pinch/pistol grip around the 2 cm-diameter rod. The wrist rotates the mug about the handle\u2019s long axis to lift it off a surface, bring it toward the mouth, and tilt it so liquid pours out. Because the mug\u2019s center of mass sits several centimetres forward of the grip point, the user feels a constant forward torque that must be countered by forearm pronation. Typical motion sequence: reach \u2192 grasp handle with C-shaped hand \u2192 elbow flexion to raise \u2192 wrist supination/pronation to adjust tilt \u2192 brief static hold while \u2018drinking\u2019 \u2192 lower and release. The mug itself offers little compliance; it feels rigid and maintains its cylindrical outline, but its inertia is clearly felt as the weight shifts farther from the wrist when tilted."

    "interactionDeduction": "Users adopt a full power grip: all fingers wrap around the wooden shaft, thumb closes over the index finger, and the handle rests diagonally across the palm. Most will grasp close to the butt end to maximize swing leverage. Interaction involves large-amplitude shoulder and elbow motion\u2014raising the axe overhead or to the side, then accelerating it through a chopping arc generated by trunk rotation and elbow extension. The head-heavy inertia causes a pronounced lag at swing initiation and strong momentum at follow-through, which the user must dampen with wrist flexors when stopping. Secondary manipulation includes minor wrist roll for aim adjustment and two-handed grips for heavier chops. The virtual axe gives the sensation of a concentrated mass at the far end; once the impact animation plays, the haptic expectation is a sudden stop and vibration through the handle, after which the user relaxes grip pressure to reset."

    "interactionDeduction": "Users wrap a firm power grip around the cylindrical handle, often near the midpoint or slightly toward the end opposite the head. Typical motion pattern: wrist and elbow cock backward, then snap forward in a short, high-precision arc to strike a target. Because the mass is concentrated in the rectangular head, users perceive a pendulum effect\u2014initial resistance followed by rapid acceleration. On \u2018impact\u2019 the hammer stops abruptly while the arm continues a few millimetres, creating an expected jolt that propagates back through the stiff handle. Repetitive strikes lead to a rhythmic squeeze-release pattern where grip tightens during the downswing and relaxes during the upswing."

    "interactionDeduction": "Users form a secure power grip around the short, straight handle, with the blade curving forward and inward. Interaction consists of sweeping, semi-circular cutting motions: the forearm rotates inward while the wrist arcs so the blade\u2019s inner edge hooks vegetation. Movements are generally lateral or diagonal across the body, followed by a pull toward the user\u2019s torso. Because the curved blade distributes moderate weight along its arc, users feel forward-weighted inertia but less of a single heavy point than with an axe. During each stroke the sickle glides through resistant material; the user expects a slight drag followed by a sudden release once the cut completes, producing a brief jerk along the handle\u2019s axis."
