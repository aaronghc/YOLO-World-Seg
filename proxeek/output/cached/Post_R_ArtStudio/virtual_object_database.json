    "interactionDeduction": "Users will pick up the marker with a tripod-style precision grip\u2014thumb and index finger opposing each other near the writing tip, middle finger supporting underneath, remaining fingers curled into the palm. The hand stays in a pen-like orientation with the shaft resting lightly against the first web space. Wrist and forearm perform small pivoting motions while the fingers modulate pressure to lay down strokes on a drawing surface. Occasional axial rotation of the shaft between the fingertips helps re-angle the chisel tip for broader vs. finer lines. The object itself offers little resistance; its low mass lets it start and stop quickly with minimal inertia. The rigid plastic body maintains shape during use, and the user feels a smooth, evenly round 17 mm diameter throughout the grasp area."

    "interactionDeduction": "The paint tube is first grasped with a light power grip around its flattened body; the thumb rests on one flat side while the fingers wrap underneath. To dispense paint, the user translates this to a squeeze\u2014thumb pressing toward the fingers, causing the malleable metal/plastic body to deform. Simultaneously or beforehand, the other hand may perform a precision grip on the cap to twist it open. During squeezing, the tube\u2019s body yields compliantly, providing soft resistance that increases as the remaining paint volume decreases; on release, the material partially rebounds. Users may slide their pinched fingers from the sealed tail end toward the nozzle to \u2018roll up\u2019 the tube, generating a progressive squeezing motion. Interaction is short bursts of compression followed by relaxation, with frequent re-gripping as the tube flattens."

For broader strokes or heavier paint loads, a relaxed power grip farther back on the handle may be used, involving the whole palm and enabling longer sweeping motions driven from the shoulder and elbow. During painting, the hand executes smooth translations, pitch and yaw rotations, and slight axial rolls to vary brush angle and bristle spread. The handle remains rigid and lightweight, while the distal bristles visibly flex and splay upon contact with the canvas, giving the user compliant tactile feedback at the fingertip through the handle."

    "interactionDeduction": "The roller is typically held with a firm cylindrical power grip around the molded handle\u2014fingers curling fully, thumb opposed. For large surfaces or overhead work, a second hand can support the stem or rear of the handle for added control. Painting involves long forearm and shoulder arcs, pressing the foam-covered roller against a surface and rolling it away from the body in repeated strokes. The user\u2019s wrist pronates/supinates slightly to keep even pressure as the roller drum spins freely on its axle, providing a mild rotational inertia and subtle vibration as it turns. Because the mass is concentrated in the drum, the tool feels moderately top-heavy; users sense this when starting or stopping motion, requiring counter-torque from the wrist. The handle itself remains rigid with no deformation, while the roller head compresses slightly against the surface, conveying a cushioned yet resistant contact through the metal frame."
