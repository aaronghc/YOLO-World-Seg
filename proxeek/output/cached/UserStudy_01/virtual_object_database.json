    "interactionDeduction": "The user will wrap the fingers and thumb around the wooden shaft in a power-grip, usually with the hand positioned 3\u20135 cm above the end of the handle so the little finger rests close to the butt. One or two hands may be used, but single-hand swings are most common. After lifting, the wrist, elbow, and shoulder generate an arcing swing so the metal head strikes a target. Because the mass is concentrated in the head, the handle feels light while the distal end feels heavy, causing a noticeable pendulum effect that the user controls by tightening or loosening the grip. Upon impact the head stops abruptly while recoil force travels through the handle into the user\u2019s palm, prompting a slight vibration and a need to re-stabilize the wrist. Fine manipulation such as tapping requires small wrist flicks, whereas powerful blows require a full arm motion followed by a deceleration phase to avoid over-swinging."

    "interactionDeduction": "The user encloses the 3 cm-diameter hilt with one or two hands in a cylindrical power-grip similar to holding a flashlight or fencing foil. The thumb or index finger activates an on/off switch near the thumb pad. Once ignited, the user executes wide slashing and thrusting motions, pivoting mainly from the shoulders and wrists. Because the weight is balanced entirely in the hilt, the blade feels virtually massless, allowing extremely quick directional changes and rapid wrist rotations without noticeable tip inertia. The hilt itself remains cool to the touch. When the luminous blade meets a virtual object, the user feels little mechanical resistance but receives a momentary vibration or stop to indicate cutting contact, after which the stroke continues unimpeded as if slicing through the material."

    "interactionDeduction": "The user pinches or loosely power-grips the horizontal cylindrical handle, positioning the thumb on the front side and the fingers curled underneath. Interaction consists of pushing or pulling the handle along its linear rail path (roughly \u00b110 cm). Movement is shoulder-dominant for large shifts and finger-dominant for fine adjustments. Moderate static friction must be overcome at initiation, followed by steady resistive force that communicates mechanical drag. At predetermined detents the user feels a tactile notch and a mild snap-in, giving discrete feedback about slider position. Releasing the handle lets it remain in place; no spring return is implied unless the application imposes one."

During the first half of the 4 cm travel the force increases progressively; near mid-stroke a mechanical 'snap' or click is felt indicating actuation.

Under calm conditions the surface offers modest resistance\u2014slightly firmer than gelatin\u2014so the hand gently depresses the outer layer before it elastically rebounds, creating a short, wobbly oscillation. When the slime becomes defensive, multiple narrow cone-shaped spikes project outward. The user then feels several rigid, point-contact pressures distributed over the palm or fingers, each spike resisting further compression. Quick withdrawal or a sideways swat with the forearm may occur to avoid the sharp tips. Any strike from the user produces a brief hard impact followed by a slippery slide as the smooth, semi-wet skin reduces friction."
