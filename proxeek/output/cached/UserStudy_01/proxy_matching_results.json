One or two hands may be used, but single-hand swings are most common. After lifting, the wrist, elbow, and shoulder generate an arcing swing so the metal head strikes a target. Because the mass is concentrated in the head, the handle feels light while the distal end feels heavy, causing a noticeable pendulum effect that the user controls by tightening or loosening the grip. Upon impact the head stops abruptly while recoil force travels through the handle into the user\u2019s palm, prompting a slight vibration and a need to re-stabilize the wrist. Fine manipulation such as tapping requires small wrist flicks, whereas powerful blows require a full arm motion followed by a deceleration phase to avoid over-swinging."

Moderate static friction must be overcome at initiation, followed by steady resistive force that communicates mechanical drag. At predetermined detents the user feels a tactile notch and a mild snap-in, giving discrete feedback about slider position. Releasing the handle lets it remain in place; no spring return is implied unless the application imposes one."
