    "contactUtilizationMethod": "Hold the wooden spine with thumb on one flat face and index finger along the top edge, then move the bristle edge in short cutting strokes",
    "substrateUtilizationMethod": "Collapse the stick and place it flat; run the bristle edge along the grooved telescoping segments.",

    "expectedHapticFeedback": "Cut the steak with a knife. When slicing through the steak, the sawing motion creates rhythmic resistance pulses.",
    "expressivity_rating": 3,
    "expressivity_explanation": "The segment grooves give periodic bumps as the bristles pass, but the feel is too rigid and metallic for realistic slicing.",
    "realism_rating": 3,
    "realism_explanation": "The grooved segments produce repeated, clear pulses under the bristles, loosely evoking the sawing feel of cutting meat."
