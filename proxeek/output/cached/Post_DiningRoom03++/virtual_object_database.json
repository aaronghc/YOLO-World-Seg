    "interactionDeduction": "Users will employ a precision\u2013power hybrid grip: thumb and index pinch the narrow handle while the remaining fingers curl for stability. Typical motions include (1) downward stabbing to pierce food, requiring short wrist-driven thrusts and slight forearm pronation; (2) scooping or lifting, where the fork is supinated and elevated toward the mouth; and (3) cutting assistance, where the fork is held steady while the knife saws. During these actions the fork offers minimal inertia\u2014only a light metallic mass that follows any wrist rotation without noticeable lag. When its tines strike a plate or penetrate food, small, high-frequency vibrations travel through the rigid stainless-steel shaft to the user\u2019s fingers, reinforcing a sensation of hardness. The flat, 2\u20133 mm thick handle presses against the finger pads, while the four narrow tines give localized pressure points if touched. Temperature feels cool and conductive, matching polished metal that quickly adopts room or body temperature after prolonged grasp."

    "interactionDeduction": "Users grasp the elongated handle with a precision grip\u2014thumb on one side, index finger extended along the spine for control, and the remaining fingers wrapping underneath. Primary motions are: (1) sawing back-and-forth with small horizontal strokes to cut food, pairing downward pressure with micro-oscillations from the wrist and elbow; (2) spreading, which uses lateral sweeping arcs with the blade angled. The knife is light but slightly tip-heavy, so users feel a faint forward moment when lifting. As the blade meets food or a plate, low-amplitude vibrations and a sudden stop in motion communicate contact; harder foods create higher-frequency feedback. The thin, rigid blade offers no deformation while the smooth stainless surface feels uniformly cool and slick. Edge contact feels sharper and more localized than the broad handle, helping users orient the blade without visual confirmation."

    "interactionDeduction": "The spoon is held with a relaxed precision grip: thumb atop or alongside the handle, index and middle fingers beneath, allowing the bowl to dip and tilt. Interaction sequence: dip the bowl into a liquid or semi-solid, apply a light scooping upward pull driven by elbow flexion, then supinate the forearm to level the spoon for transport to the mouth. Added food mass creates a noticeable increase in inertia, so users sense a slight tug when accelerating or decelerating. When the metal bowl contacts a hard surface (bowl bottom, plate rim) a brief metallic clink and vibration travel through the handle. The concave bowl provides a smooth continuous curve felt by the lips or tongue if virtually tasted, whereas the 2\u20133 mm thick handle offers flat edges for finger reference. Stainless finish conveys cool, hard, slippery tactile cues."

    "interactionDeduction": "Users perform a cylindrical power grip around the shaker\u2019s 4 cm diameter body\u2014thumb, index, and middle fingers oppose the palm while ring and pinky add support. To dispense, they invert the shaker and execute rapid wrist flicks or short vertical shakes, each lasting ~0.3 s. These motions create internal particle movement: users perceive subtle momentum shifts and muffled rattling as pepper granules strike internal walls before falling out. The external glass/metal shell feels rigid and cool, with faint surface texture ridges near the cap for grip. Because the shaker is light, it follows wrist direction easily, but the granular slosh introduces a delayed counter-motion that the user senses as inertia change. Returning the shaker upright stops the flow and particle sound, giving immediate haptic confirmation of seasoning completion."
