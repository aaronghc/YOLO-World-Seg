Initial interaction often involves twisting the small cap between thumb and index finger (precision grip) to open it. Once uncapped, users orient the nozzle downward over a palette and apply intermittent or sustained squeezing forces with the thumb and fingers. The pliable metal body buckles inward under pressure, giving tactile feedback of yielding material, then partially rebounds when pressure is released. The lower half of the hand remains mostly static; force comes from finger flexion. The virtual response is a visible extrusion of paint proportional to squeeze intensity, while the tube visually dents where pressed but retains its overall shape, mirroring the real-world compliance sensed by the user."
