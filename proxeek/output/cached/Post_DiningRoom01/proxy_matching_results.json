Primary manipulation is a sawing or slicing motion\u2014forward/backward strokes combined with gentle downward pressure\u2014executed through elbow extension/flexion and subtle wrist deviation. Secondary use includes spreading butter with a flatter, sweeping wrist motion. Contact is along the flat, narrow handle; the user\u2019s index finger may extend along the spine for control. Because the virtual blade is visually sharp yet physically non-dangerous, the user relies mostly on visual feedback, feeling only the lightweight, rigid handle. Inertia is minimal; there is no perceived deformation, and the knife visually slices through food with little force reflected haptically."

      "interactionDeduction": "The pepper shaker is grasped with a cylindrical power grip: fingers wrap fully around the ~4 cm diameter body while the thumb braces opposite. Interaction involves short, rapid wrist flicks in vertical and slightly angled directions to shake pepper out of the perforated lid. These flicks generate brief inertial lag of the shaker\u2019s contents, giving the user discrete start-stop motions. The body may also be rotated between finger-tips for aiming or unscrewing, employing a precision twist with thumb and index finger opposing while other fingers cradle the base. Haptically, the user feels a small, rigid cylinder with a bit of internal mass shifting (auditory/visual cues in VR); resistance is low, and the shaker remains solid with no external deformation."
