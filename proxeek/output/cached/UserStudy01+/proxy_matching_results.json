Interaction consists of pushing or pulling the handle along a single linear rail path about 20\u201330 cm long. The arm moves largely in the sagittal plane while the wrist stays neutral, and the shoulder supplies most of the translation force. Resistance is moderate and constant; at the end of travel the handle comes to a firm stop or detents into discrete positions before reversing direction. Users often execute short, rhythmic shoves to fine-tune position or a single long pull when commanding a large change."
