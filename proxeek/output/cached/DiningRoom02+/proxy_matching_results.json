Interaction consists of lifting, inverting, and rapidly oscillating the wrist (shake motion) so that pepper visually falls from the perforated cap. Some users may also twist the cap; this requires a bimanual action where the non-dominant hand stabilizes the body while the dominant hand rotates the lid using fingertip friction. Inertia cues are light but noticeable when the shaker changes direction during shaking; the mass feels concentrated in the center. The container is rigid with no shape change, and its smooth glass or metal surface may feel slightly cool. During each shake the object itself does not move internally (no liquid slosh), so the only perceived response is subtle momentum lag and possibly a faint vibration cue corresponding to pepper granules dispensing."
