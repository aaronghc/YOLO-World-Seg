    "expressivity_explanation": "Soft fabric and underlying cushioning provide moderate, continuous drag that changes with pressure. Large surface allows varied speed and path, giving decent expressivity.",

    "realism_explanation": "Soft flat cushion offers mild uniform resistance, giving a vague sense of drag, but fabric friction and lack of immersion limit realism."
