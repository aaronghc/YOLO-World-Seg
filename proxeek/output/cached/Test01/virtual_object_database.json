Between strikes the stick will roll slightly in the fingertips for angle adjustment or occasional twirling. Because the stick is light and rigid, the user should feel very low inertia, crisp stopping points, and subtle vibration that decays immediately after each impact."

The hand rises a few centimeters, translates horizontally above the virtual board, and lowers for placement. Motions are slow and deliberate to avoid knocking other pieces. A dense, marble-like mass gives noticeable but manageable inertia, so the user perceives a slight lag when starting or stopping motion. Once set down, the piece offers no movement until grasped again, reinforcing a solid, polished object response."

The wrist rotates to invert the dropper tip downward, and micro-adjusted bulb squeezes meter individual droplets. Throughout, the glass section feels rigid and cool, while the bulb feels soft, slightly tacky, and springy, giving immediate tactile confirmation of dosage control."

Aiming involves forearm rotation and shoulder alignment with sights. Pulling the trigger entails a gradual squeeze with increasing resistance, culminating in a crisp \u2018break\u2019 point that triggers the firing event. Immediately after the break, the user should feel a brief rearward kick (simulated recoil) transmitted through the grip. The off-hand may cup beneath the grip for added stability during rapid-fire sequences."

Fingers may trace the knit texture across the head or body, feeling small ridges and valleys. Interaction sessions range from momentary pats to prolonged holding, with the toy remaining passive\u2014its only response is compliant deformation and gradual shape recovery."
