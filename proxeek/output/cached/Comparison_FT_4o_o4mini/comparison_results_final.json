However, the interactivity is limited due to the following reasons:\n\n1. **Degrees of Freedom**: The keyboard does not have a hinge mechanism like a chest lid, which would provide a more realistic pivoting action. The user must manually hold one side down, which does not mimic the natural hinge action of a chest.\n\n2. **Weight and Balance**: While the keyboard has some weight, it does not replicate the balance and resistance one would expect from a chest lid. The weight distribution is not the same, and the keyboard may not stay in place as a chest lid would.\n\n3. **Interactive Feedback**: There is no tactile feedback or resistance that mimics the feeling of opening a chest lid. The keyboard lacks the mechanical resistance and sound that would be present in a real chest.\n\nOverall, while the keyboard can be used to simulate the action to some extent, it lacks the necessary interactive elements to fully replicate the experience of opening a chest.",

The selfie-stick's size and proportions are significantly different from those of a dropper, which is typically small and designed to be held comfortably between the thumb and forefinger for precise liquid dispensing. The selfie-stick is larger and intended for a different grip style, which disrupts the expected grip formation for a dropper. Additionally, the basic shape category is different, as the selfie-stick is more elongated and cylindrical, whereas a dropper has a bulbous end for squeezing. Key affordances for gripping and manipulating a dropper are absent in the selfie-stick, making it a poor proxy for the intended interaction.",
