The bar\u2019s small width (4 cm) lets the fingers curl underneath while the thumb stabilises the top edge. After lifting, the surprising 1 kg virtual mass creates downward inertial resistance in the wrist and elbow, forcing the user to engage the larger arm muscles. Typical manipulations include simple lift-and-hold, slow tilting in all axes, and momentary setting down on a tabletop to illustrate weight. The bar itself remains perfectly rigid and unmoving in shape, only translating/rotating as the user dictates; no deformation or compliance occurs."

Contacts are primarily light taps and smooth strokes that slide laterally or vertically across the 0.26 m \u00d7 0.21 m surface. The active body part is the distal end of the brush (held in the user\u2019s hand) or, during finger-painting exploration, the pad of the index finger. Each stroke lasts from fractions of a second (dab) to several seconds (long sweep). The canvas offers immovable, rigid resistance; it does not translate, rotate, or noticeably deform. Haptically it presents a flat, slightly textured plane that stops the brush tip with minimal indentation, immediately reflecting any force back to the user as a firm barrier."

Typical motion is a light stroke from head toward tail, wrist moving in a 15\u201320 cm arc while maintaining minimal normal force. Contact duration ranges from brief taps to 2\u20133 second glides. The fish provides a cool, slightly slick surface with moderate stiffness\u2014yielding only a few millimetres before springing back\u2014simulating protective plating. It remains stationary; user input does not cause appreciable displacement or squirming."

Repeated squeeze-and-release cycles occur: thumb and index compress toward the tube axis (~1 cm travel) to expel liquid, then relax to let the bulb spring back, drawing fluid. Wrist rolls and subtle forearm supination/ pronation aim the tapered tip above a target vessel. The bulb visibly deforms and re-expands in sync with finger motion, while the glass shaft stays rigid and very light (\u224810 g total mass). A slight shift in centre-of-mass toward the tip can be felt when the dropper fills with virtual fluid."
