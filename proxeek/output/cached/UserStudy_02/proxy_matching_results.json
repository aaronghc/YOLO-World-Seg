To draw liquid, they rotate the wrist so the tip points downward, then squeeze the soft bulb using a pad-to-pad pinch (thumb squeezing toward index). The bulb compresses 5-10 mm with low force and provides a spring-back sensation on release, producing a subtle suction pull perceived through the fingers. The tube remains rigid and lightweight, causing almost no inertial load. Dispensing involves slight wrist rotations and controlled bulb presses to eject droplets, with sequential squeeze-release cycles until empty."
