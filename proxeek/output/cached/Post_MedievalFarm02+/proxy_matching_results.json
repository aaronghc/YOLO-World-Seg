Contact is simulated as a slicing interaction: when the curved edge meets virtual vegetation it offers light progressive resistance followed by a quick release as the cut completes.

      "interactionDeduction": "Users hold the short handle with a firm power grip, thumb and fingers wrapping fully around the roughly 3\u20134 cm-diameter shaft. Typical motion is a sweeping, inward pulling arc generated by elbow flexion and trunk rotation\u2014mimicking harvesting strokes. The moderate forward weight in the curved blade yields a lighter yet noticeable centrifugal pull; once the stroke starts, the blade\u2019s arc wants to continue, requiring the user to resist overswing. Contact is simulated as a slicing interaction: when the curved edge meets virtual vegetation it offers light progressive resistance followed by a quick release as the cut completes. The sickle remains rigid, but the curved outline will occasionally brush against the user\u2019s forearm or sleeve if they over-rotate, reinforcing awareness of blade presence."
