The curved blade extends forward then sweeps back, so functional use involves a pulling, slicing motion: the user swings the wrist inward toward the body while flexing the elbow, letting the blade cut during the pull stroke. Because mass is distributed along the arc rather than concentrated at a single point, the tool feels moderately front-heavy but balanced enough for quick, repetitive cuts. Users may perform short, rhythmic wrist-led motions for harvesting vegetation, occasionally reversing grip orientation to reach awkward angles. During idle inspection the sickle may be rotated by rolling the handle between the fingertips, but active cutting keeps the grip firm with minimal finger repositioning. The virtual blade remains rigid and does not deform; any feedback comes from simulated drag and micro-impacts as the edge meets virtual material."
