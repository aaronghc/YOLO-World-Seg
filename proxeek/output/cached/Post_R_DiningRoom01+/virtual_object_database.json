    "interactionDeduction": "The user will pick up the fork by wrapping thumb, index, and middle finger around the narrow handle (precision/pencil-like grip). The index finger often lies along the spine to steer the tines. Typical motions include (1) pronating the wrist to place the fork in a downward-facing position for stabbing or holding food, (2) small vertical jabs to pierce food, (3) scooping/sweeping motions to collect pieces, and (4) supinating the wrist to bring the fork to the mouth. Because the fork is light, little inertial resistance is felt; however, brief vibrations travel through the handle when the metal tines strike a plate. The user\u2019s fingers contact a smooth, hard, 2\u20133 mm-thick stainless surface with four thin prongs extending about 30 mm from the handle\u2019s end."

Primary manipulations are (1) pushing the edge downward while sawing forward/back to cut food, (2) sliding strokes to spread butter, and (3) using the knife as a stabilizer to push food onto the fork. Movements involve wrist flexion/extension and forearm sawing motions. The knife offers light inertia but noticeable resistance when the edge meets food, transmitting a hard metallic vibration into the handle. The blade\u2019s outline is flat and thin (~2 mm) with a smooth, cool, rigid stainless feel throughout."

    "interactionDeduction": "The spoon is lifted with a precision grip similar to the fork: thumb and fingers wrap around the handle while the index finger may rest along the back for control. Key motions include (1) dipping the bowl into liquids or semi-solids, (2) scooping via a slight wrist flexion followed by elevation, and (3) gentle tilting (supination) to pour contents into the mouth or another container. Users may also stir beverages by tracing small circles with the wrist. The object is lightweight; the main inertial feedback comes from the mass of any collected food in the bowl. The bowl\u2019s concave outline is felt by the lips, and finger pads perceive a smooth, hard, cool stainless surface along a 16 cm elongated tool."

    "interactionDeduction": "The pepper shaker is typically grasped with a loose power grip: thumb, index, and middle fingers encircle the 4 cm-diameter cylindrical body while the palm supports the underside. Interaction involves brisk up-and-down or side-to-side shaking driven by wrist and forearm motions to sprinkle pepper. Users may briefly invert it against the other hand or food surface for several short bursts, then set it back down. A secondary manipulation is twisting the cap (using a fingertip pinch) to open or adjust holes. The shaker\u2019s low mass gives minimal inertial load, but the moving granules generate faint internal rattling and shifting center-of-mass cues during acceleration. Fingers sense a smooth, hard exterior; the cool metal/plastic top contrasts slightly with the glass or plastic body."
