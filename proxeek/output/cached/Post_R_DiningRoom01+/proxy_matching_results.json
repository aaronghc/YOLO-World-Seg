Key motions include (1) dipping the bowl into liquids or semi-solids, (2) scooping via a slight wrist flexion followed by elevation, and (3) gentle tilting (supination) to pour contents into the mouth or another container. Users may also stir beverages by tracing small circles with the wrist. The object is lightweight; the main inertial feedback comes from the mass of any collected food in the bowl. The bowl\u2019s concave outline is felt by the lips, and finger pads perceive a smooth, hard, cool stainless surface along a 16 cm elongated tool."

      "interactionDeduction": "The pepper shaker is typically grasped with a loose power grip: thumb, index, and middle fingers encircle the 4 cm-diameter cylindrical body while the palm supports the underside. Interaction involves brisk up-and-down or side-to-side shaking driven by wrist and forearm motions to sprinkle pepper. Users may briefly invert it against the other hand or food surface for several short bursts, then set it back down. A secondary manipulation is twisting the cap (using a fingertip pinch) to open or adjust holes. The shaker\u2019s low mass gives minimal inertial load, but the moving granules generate faint internal rattling and shifting center-of-mass cues during acceleration. Fingers sense a smooth, hard exterior; the cool metal/plastic top contrasts slightly with the glass or plastic body."
