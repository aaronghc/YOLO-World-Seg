    "expressivity_rating": 2,
    "expressivity_explanation": "Soft plush absorbs most force; stitches are shallow and widely spaced, giving very faint feedback without clear rhythmic pulses.",
    "realism_rating": 4,
    "realism_explanation": "Soft stuffing compresses and panel stitching catches periodically, giving gentle pulses. Resistance is lighter and bulkier than steak but directionally similar."
