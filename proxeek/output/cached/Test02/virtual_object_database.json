The motion is a short, piston-like thrust: wrist remains mostly neutral while elbow and shoulder supply a quick 4\u20136 cm travel. Contact is concentrated at the center of the circular cap. As force increases, the cap offers progressive spring resistance, then bottoms out against an internal stop before immediately rebounding when released. Haptically, the user expects a firm initial resistance, a smooth compression over the 4 cm stroke, a soft mechanical 'click' or detent at full travel, and a rapid return to the starting height."

Movements are slow strokes or light taps, fingers slightly spread to let leaves slip between them. Contact focuses on finger pads and sometimes the dorsal side of the hand as users scoop upward from pot rim to leaf tips. The leaves flex away, providing low-force, compliant resistance (<0.5 N), then spring back once the hand passes. Users perceive slight textural variations\u2014the faint ridges of veins\u2014while overall softness conveys living plant material."

    "interactionDeduction": "The globe invites a tangential push or drag gesture. A user typically places one or two fingertips or the side of the hand on the sphere and applies a sweeping arc motion horizontally, initiating rotation about the fixed vertical axis. Larger motions might use the whole palm, with wrist pronation/supination controlling spin speed. The sphere responds with smooth, low-friction inertia\u2014initial force overcomes static friction, after which it glides freely, gradually decelerating due to mild bearing resistance. Users may also steady the globe by lightly pinching the meridian ring while the opposite hand spins the sphere."

    "interactionDeduction": "Interaction is foot-centric: the user lines up a virtual kick, swinging the leg from hip and knee to strike the ball with the instep or toe. Contact duration is brief (~20 ms) and forceful, producing an elastic compression of the ball\u2019s surface followed by rapid restitution\u2014the classic 'pop' sensation. The ball departs along the kick vector with velocity proportional to applied force and exhibits realistic spin if contact is off-center. Secondary interactions include trapping or dribbling with the inside of the foot, where sustained, softer pushes keep the ball close."

Release relies on the key\u2019s spring, returning the finger to the neutral position for the next note. Chords require simultaneous multi-finger depression, and glissandos generate continuous fingertip slides across sequential keys, each key momentarily depressing under the moving finger."
