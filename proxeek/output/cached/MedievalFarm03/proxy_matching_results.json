      "interactionDeduction": "Users curl their fingers around the short cylindrical handle in a power grip, wrist oriented so the curved blade points forward and inward toward the forearm. Interaction consists of sweeping semicircular pull-strokes: the elbow leads while the wrist pronates slightly, dragging the blade through virtual vegetation. Because the mass is distributed along the curved blade rather than at a single point, the user feels moderate forward-weighted inertia that encourages a fluid slicing motion rather than abrupt chops. When the blade encounters resistance, the system should simulate a brief tug and rapid cessation of motion, as though stalks are severed. Returning strokes are lighter, resetting for the next cut. A proxy can be a short handle with a light but slightly forward-weighted extension (e.g., a plastic arc) to evoke the balanced yet biased inertia."
