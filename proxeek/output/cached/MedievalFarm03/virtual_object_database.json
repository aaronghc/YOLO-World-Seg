    "interactionDeduction": "Users will perform a precision-to-power hybrid grip: the index and middle finger slip through the 2 cm-diameter handle while the thumb pinches the outside, or the whole hand wraps around the handle in a relaxed fist. The hand lifts the mug in a forearm curl, followed by wrist supination to bring the rim to the lips. Fine wrist rotation (~30-50\u00b0) tips the vessel, letting virtual liquid flow; the mug\u2019s center of mass, offset from the grip point, produces a noticeable torque that the user compensates for with thumb and little-finger counter-pressure. After a sip, the mug is returned through the reverse motion and may be set down with a gentle vertical translation. Haptically the mug responds as a moderately heavy object (as if full), resisting sudden starts/stops and creating slight rotational inertia about the handle axis; no deformation is felt because it is rigid. If a real proxy is supplied, a cylindrical rod or small loop matching the handle diameter delivers the essential outline, while the weight can be simulated by attaching modest mass to the rod."

Some users will add a secondary support hand nearer the head for precise placement, then slide it down for full-force swings. Interaction involves wide shoulder-driven arcs or over-the-head chopping motions with rapid acceleration and abrupt deceleration on impact. Because the mass is head-heavy, the user senses the head pulling the swing forward and a momentary lag when changing direction, encouraging follow-through. Upon striking a target, a short sharp vibration and rebound force is expected as the virtual blade \u2018bites\u2019 then stops; the system may briefly lock the position to convey embedment. A suitable physical proxy is a weighted stick whose distal end is heavier to replicate the forward inertia."

    "interactionDeduction": "Users grasp the handle in a classic hammer fist grip\u2014thumb diagonal across the fingers, palm wrapped tightly. Primary motion is elbow-driven downward strikes or short horizontal taps, often with only one hand. The head\u2019s concentrated mass produces a pendulum effect: the handle feels light until mid-swing, then the user must brake the head at impact. Contact with a surface yields a sudden stop followed by a small recoil vibration suggesting a solid hit. Because the striking face is broader than an axe, precision is less critical; users may rapidly repeat strikes, so the interaction alternates between quick lifts and jolting stops. A realistic proxy is a short dowel with a heavy block attached near the top to convey head-heavy inertia and a flat striking face."

    "interactionDeduction": "Users curl their fingers around the short cylindrical handle in a power grip, wrist oriented so the curved blade points forward and inward toward the forearm. Interaction consists of sweeping semicircular pull-strokes: the elbow leads while the wrist pronates slightly, dragging the blade through virtual vegetation. Because the mass is distributed along the curved blade rather than at a single point, the user feels moderate forward-weighted inertia that encourages a fluid slicing motion rather than abrupt chops. When the blade encounters resistance, the system should simulate a brief tug and rapid cessation of motion, as though stalks are severed. Returning strokes are lighter, resetting for the next cut. A proxy can be a short handle with a light but slightly forward-weighted extension (e.g., a plastic arc) to evoke the balanced yet biased inertia."
