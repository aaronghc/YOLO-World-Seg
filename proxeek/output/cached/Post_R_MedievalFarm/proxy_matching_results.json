Interaction involves sweeping, hooking motions: users swing the blade in semicircular arcs toward vegetation, then pull inward to slice. The inertia is moderate and distributed along the curved blade, giving a forward-weighted but smoother feel than an axe; the tool tends to guide itself through the arc once in motion. During cutting strokes the wrist drives pronation\u2013supination combined with elbow flexion, and the user feels a continuous resistive drag when the blade contacts virtual stalks. The sickle remains rigid; perceived feedback stems from the offset mass of the blade and the shearing resistance during contact."
