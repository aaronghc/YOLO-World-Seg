      "utilizationMethod": "Grip the narrow neck of the bottle (\u22482\u20133 cm diameter) as though it were the mug handle, keeping the heavier body hanging below your hand.  This offset mass reproduces the mug\u2019s forward roll when lifted.  Pitching the wrist 30\u201370\u00b0 gives clear inertial resistance from the full bottle, simulating the sensation of tilting a full mug toward the mouth."

      "utilizationMethod": "Clamp both hands around one edge of the plush shell and swing the opposite, padded bulk forward as the axe head.  The size and moderate weight offer noticeable inertia while the soft impact surface lets users safely practice the abrupt stop of a virtual chop."

      "utilizationMethod": "Clasp one narrow end of the box, letting the box\u2019s bulk project outward as the striking head. Because the box is wider than your grip, each downward tap delivers a solid stop\u2014useful for simulating flat-faced mallet blows in VR."

Orient the phone clamp forward and downward; its claw-like curve substitutes for the sickle blade, while the collapsed pole provides moderate forward inertia. Perform elbow-driven pulling arcs, feeling the clamp drag through the air like a hooked cutter."
