      "proxyObjectName": "clear plastic jar or container (stackable design)",
      "utilizationMethod": "Hook two fingers through the lip of the jar while the thumb braces the outer wall, treating the rim as a circular handle. Lift and tilt it; the jar\u2019s cylindrical body and empty volume give a convincing mug outline, and if you partially fill it with water it can add the desired mass without altering the object."

      "virtualObjectName": "Axe",
      "proxyObjectName": "grey and white camouflage-patterned video game controller",
      "utilizationMethod": "Grasp the controller by a single grip horn so the rest of the body hangs outward as a weighted head. Swinging this asymmetrically held mass offers torque that strives to rotate the wrist downward, analogously to how an axe head tries to drop during a chop."

    {
      "virtualObjectName": "Hammer",
      "proxyObjectName": "green plush turtle shell with white rim",
      "utilizationMethod": "Curl your fingers around the white plush rim, letting the large soft dome hang over your fist like an oversized, padded hammer head. Its considerable size and off-centre mass make the head dip naturally, while the softness lets you perform full swings and feel a cushioned yet abrupt stop when it contacts a surface."

      "virtualObjectName": "Sickle",
      "proxyObjectName": "black telescopic selfie stick with adjustable phone holder",
      "utilizationMethod": "Hold the rubberized black grip as the sickle handle; extend a single telescope segment so the rod plus phone clamp form a curved, forward-projecting mass. The distributed weight along the rod closely mirrors a sickle blade, allowing full-scale elbow and wrist sweeps that replicate harvesting strokes."
